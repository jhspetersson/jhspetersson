## Hi, I'm Ivan, and here you can find a few projects of mine

🦀 [fselect](https://github.com/jhspetersson/fselect) ⭐**4.4k**

I was never able to memorize all the options of `find`, so I wrote my own tool with SQL-like query syntax.

Tons of various file characteristics to search against, `.gitignore` support, interactive mode, export to JSON, and much more.

My first real experience with Rust, and I loved it!

🦀 [git-task](https://github.com/jhspetersson/git-task)

Your local bug tracker. It stores everything in a Git repository under a "hidden" ref (though you can make it visible alongside other branches).

It supports syncing issues with GitHub, Gitlab and Jira Cloud. Redmine and YouTrack are planned.

Presented at the [GitMerge 2024](https://git-merge.com) conference. For hardcore Git CLI users.

♨️ [packrat](https://github.com/jhspetersson/packrat)

A small library for enhancing Java streams with custom intermediate operations (“gatherers”). It can be a good source of inspiration for writing your own gatherers.

Requires JDK 24 or later!

🎮 [Q2048](https://github.com/jhspetersson/q2048)

A remake of the well-known [2048](https://play2048.co) puzzle on the Quake engine.

As a huge fan of Quake, I took part in an anniversary online event called [QuakeExpo](https://qexpo2016.com): people showcasing their Quake mods, maps, models, whatever.
Yes, it's been a while since the brand first shook the gaming community, but even today you can find all kinds of goodies for one of the most brilliant games ever.
