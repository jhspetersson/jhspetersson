## Hi, I'm Ivan, and here you can find a few projects of mine

ü¶Ä [fselect](https://github.com/jhspetersson/fselect) ‚≠ê**4.1k**

I was never able to memorize all the options of `find`, so I wrote my own with syntax resembling SQL.

Tons of various file characteristics to search against, `.gitignore` support, interactive mode, export to JSON, and much more.

My first real experience with Rust, and I liked it!

ü¶Ä [git-task](https://github.com/jhspetersson/git-task)

Your local bug tracker. It saves everything in git repository, but under "hidden" ref (you can make it visible along all other branches though).

Supports syncing issues with GitHub, Gitlab and Jira (in development). Redmine and YouTrack are in the plans.

Was presented on [GitMerge 2024](https://git-merge.com) conference. For hardcore git CLI users.

‚ô®Ô∏è [packrat](https://github.com/jhspetersson/packrat)

A small library for Java streams enhancement with custom intermediate operations ("gatherers"). Can be a good source of inspiration for writing your own gatherers.

Planned to be finally released after JDK 24 going stable.

üéÆ [Q2048](https://github.com/jhspetersson/q2048)

This is a remake of well-known [2048](https://play2048.co) puzzle on Quake engine.

Being a huge fan of Quake, I participated in some kind of anniversary online event called [QuakeExpo](https://qexpo2016.com): people presenting their Quake mods, maps, models, whatever.
Yes, it's been a while since the brand shaked the gaming community for the first time. However, even today you can find all kinds of goodies for one of the most brilliant games ever.
