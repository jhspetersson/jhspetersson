## Hi, I'm Ivan, and here you can find a few projects of mine

ü¶Ä [fselect](https://github.com/jhspetersson/fselect) ‚≠ê**4k**

I was never able to memorize all the options of `find`, so I wrote my own with syntax resembling SQL.

Tons of various file characteristics to search against, interactive mode, export to JSON, and more.

ü¶Ä [git-task](https://github.com/jhspetersson/git-task)

Your local bug tracker. It saves everything in git repository, but under "hidden" ref (you can make it visible along all other branches though).

Supports syncing issues with GitHub, Gitlab and Jira (in development). Redmine and YouTrack are in the plans.

For hardcore git CLI users!

‚ô®Ô∏è [packrat](https://github.com/jhspetersson/packrat)

A small library for Java streams enhancement with custom intermediate operations. Planned to be finally released after JDK 24 going stable.
